1. Business Cases (Enterprise Strategic Drivers)
These drivers justify the investment for IT leaders managing corporate voice networks and Contact Centers.
* Vendor Accountability & SLA Enforcement (Carrier Management):
o Driver: When using "Bring Your Own Dialtone," it is difficult to prove if call quality issues (jitter, packet loss) are internal or caused by the SIP trunk provider.
o Solution: Ativa monitors peering and interconnect points , providing concrete data on service health and SLA compliance. This allows the enterprise to enforce vendor contracts and credit/penalty clauses for dialtone providers.
* Protection of Voice Quality (QoE) for Critical Operations:
o Driver: Poor voice quality in Contact Centers or executive calls directly impacts revenue and business reputation.
o Solution: The system monitors "Service-specific customer experience KPIs such as voice MOS" (Mean Opinion Score). This ensures that voice quality is maintained at a premium standard for critical business units.
* Operational Efficiency & MTTR Reduction:
o Driver: Troubleshooting voice issues typically involves manual packet captures and correlating logs between the SBC, the network, and the UC platform.
o Solution: Ativa automates root-cause identification by correlating alarms across domains (e.g., linking a call drop to a specific SBC capacity issue). This reduces the time IT staff spend diagnosing complex SIP signaling or media quality issues.
* Regulatory & Security Compliance:
o Driver: Enterprises facing robocall regulations or security mandates need visibility into signaling trust.
o Solution: The platform supports monitoring of STIR/SHAKEN compliance, ensuring legitimate business calls are authenticated and not blocked by downstream carriers.

2. Use Cases (Operational Scenarios)
These specific scenarios address the daily needs of Voice Engineers and Network Operations Centers (NOCs).
A. SBC & SIP Trunk Assurance
* Interconnect & Peering Monitoring: Monitor the health of peering points and interconnects where the enterprise network hands off traffic to the PSTN/Carrier. This isolates whether faults lie within the enterprise network or the carrier's network.
* SBC Resource Monitoring: Gain "resource-facing" visibility into the performance of physical or virtual SBCs (CPU, memory, concurrent session counts) and correlate this data with call quality degradation.
* VoIP & IMS Protocol Analysis: Deep monitoring of VoIP and IMS protocols to troubleshoot signaling errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx SIP errors) and registration failures.
B. Advanced Voice Troubleshooting
* End-to-End Session Tracing: Perform end-to-end tracing of SIP sessions to visualize the full call path across the network, identifying exactly where a call failed or where quality degraded.
* Selective Session Recording: Trigger "selective session recording of user-plane traffic" (media/RTP) on-demand to perform deep-dive analysis on specific reported bad calls or for compliance verification.
* Root-Cause Analysis (RCA): Automatically correlate user complaints (e.g., "choppy audio") with underlying network events, using "intuitive drill-down for root-cause identification".
* Encrypted Traffic Troubleshooting: Utilize session decoding capabilities, including support for "ephemeral encryption decoding", to troubleshoot issues within encrypted SIP/SRTP streams.
C. VIP & Departmental Monitoring
* Departmental/Tenant Dashboards: Use the platform's "multi-tenancy" and "self-service portals" to create specific views for different business units (e.g., a dashboard specifically for Contact Center operations vs. Corporate HQ), proving SLA compliance to internal stakeholders.
* VIP User Tracking: Monitor high-profile users or executives to prioritize their issues, ensuring "differentiated service quality" for critical personnel.
D. Automation & Self-Healing
* Automated Remediation of Voice Services: Configure workflows to automatically execute remedial actions such as "restarting, scaling, [or] reconfiguring" voice services or virtual SBCs when specific failure criteria are met.
* Predictive Capacity Management: Use "AI/ML-based prediction" to forecast SIP trunk utilization or SBC capacity exhaustion, allowing the enterprise to provision additional bandwidth or licenses before calls are blocked.
1. Hard Cost Savings (Vendor & CAPEX Optimization)
These metrics track direct financial recovery or avoidance of unnecessary spending.
* SLA Credit Recovery (Vendor Accountability)
o Metric: Total dollar value of SLA credits claimed vs. recovered.
o How to Track: Monitor peering and interconnect points for specific SLA violations (latency, jitter, uptime). Use the data to enforce penalties against your SIP trunk providers.
o ROI Impact: Direct cash recovery from underperforming carriers.
* SBC License & Trunk Utilization (Smart CAPEX)
o Metric: Peak concurrent session utilization vs. licensed capacity.
o How to Track: Use predictive capacity management and "what-if" scenarios to identify if you are over-provisioned (paying for unused SIP trunks/SBC licenses) or under-provisioned (risking blocked calls).
o ROI Impact: Avoid purchasing unnecessary SBC hardware/licenses or reduce monthly recurring costs (MRC) on SIP trunks by "right-sizing" contracts.
2. Operational Efficiency (Labor Reduction)
These metrics measure the reduction in engineering hours required to keep the lights on.
* Mean Time to Innocence (MTTI)
o Metric: Average time taken to identify the "fault domain" (e.g., proves the issue is the Carrier vs. the SBC vs. the LAN).
o How to Track: Utilize "cross-domain troubleshooting" and "end-to-end tracing" to isolate root causes instantly rather than organizing multi-vendor "war rooms."
o ROI Impact: Massive reduction in senior engineer hours wasted on "finger-pointing" exercises.
* Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
o Metric: Average time from issue detection to resolution.
o How to Track: Compare manual troubleshooting times against automated workflows. The system uses "automated troubleshooting" and "recommendations" to speed up fixes.
o ROI Impact: Lower support costs; IT staff can focus on strategic projects rather than fire-fighting.
* Alarm Compression Ratio
o Metric: Percentage of raw network events reduced into actionable "incidents."
o How to Track: Measure the volume of raw alerts vs. the single correlated incidents created by the "AIOps... automated alarm suppression" engine.
o ROI Impact: Reduces "alert fatigue" and prevents NOC staff from chasing phantom issues or duplicate tickets.
3. Productivity & Revenue Protection
These metrics quantify the business impact of voice quality on end-users (e.g., Contact Center agents, Executives).
* Voice Quality of Experience (QoE/MOS)
o Metric: Average Mean Opinion Score (MOS) per location or department.
o How to Track: Monitor "service-specific customer experience KPIs such as voice MOS" across all calls.
o ROI Impact: Poor voice quality in a contact center increases Average Handle Time (AHT) and frustration. Improving MOS directly correlates to agent productivity and customer satisfaction (CSAT).
* Call Setup Success Rate (CSSR) & Drop Rate
o Metric: Percentage of calls that fail to connect or drop mid-conversation.
o How to Track: Monitor signaling errors (4xx/5xx/6xx codes) via "VoIP and IMS" monitoring.
o ROI Impact: In a sales environment, a dropped call is potential lost revenue. In a support environment, it is a repeat call (higher cost).
* Automated Remediation Success Rate
o Metric: Number of issues resolved without human intervention (Zero-Touch).
o How to Track: Count the number of "reconfigurations" or "restarts" executed by the automation engine.
o ROI Impact: Zero labor cost for specific recurring tier-1 issues.
4. Risk & Compliance
* STIR/SHAKEN Compliance Rate
o Metric: Percentage of calls successfully authenticated/verified.
o How to Track: Use the "monitoring of STIR/SHAKEN compliance" feature.
o ROI Impact: Avoidance of regulatory fines and ensuring outbound business calls are not labeled as "Spam" on customer phones (which destroys answer rates).
