Executive Summary
Hammer On-Demand is a flexible performance testing solution designed to validate the stability of contact center environments during periods of change. Unlike always-on monitoring, this solution is often deployed as a strategic safeguard—either as a subscription for frequent DevOps cycles or as a "one-off" engagement with expert services to de-risk major migrations. It generates realistic customer traffic (Voice and Chat) from the cloud to stress-test infrastructure before it goes live.

1. Business Cases (Strategic Drivers)
•	De-Risking Strategic Migrations (Migration Assurance):
o	Driver: Moving from on-premise legacy platforms to CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) or hybrid clouds is high-risk. Failure on "Day 1" can be catastrophic.
o	Solution: The solution validates "expected performance and stability before go-live", ensuring that the new architecture can handle peak volumes without crashing. This supports "ongoing business or technology-driven change" and "accelerate[s] digital transformation".
•	Protection Against "Death by Patching":
o	Driver: Modern contact centers face constant updates, including "frequent IVR application releases" and "recurring voice infrastructure operating system patches".
o	Solution: By enabling "on-demand and frequent performance testing", IT teams can instantly verify that a Tuesday night security patch didn't break the IVR for Wednesday morning.
•	Operational Cost Avoidance:
o	Driver: Outages caused by untested changes result in "all-hands troubleshooting efforts" which are expensive and disruptive.
o	Solution: Catching defects in a staging or pre-production environment "minimize[s] the risk of unexpected production issues" , significantly "reducing operational costs".
•	Customer Retention & Brand Reputation:
o	Driver: Poor experiences during high-traffic events or after upgrades lead to churn.
o	Solution: The platform helps "reduce churn" by utilizing "customer-agent emulation testing" to find issues "before they impact customers".

2. Use Cases (Operational Scenarios)
A. Migration & Project-Based Stress Testing
•	Pre-Cutover Load Testing (Migration Assurance): Before flipping the switch on a new platform (e.g., Avaya to Genesys Cloud), execute a high-volume stress test to emulate peak hour traffic. This verifies that SIP trunks, SBCs, and cloud instances can handle the load.
•	Omni-Channel Validation (Voice & Chat): Context Note: As specified, this extends beyond voice.
o	Generate concurrent Chat sessions alongside Voice calls to ensure the unified desktop and routing engine (ACD) do not lock up under multi-channel stress.
•	"One-Off" Expert Service Engagements: Engage expert services to design and execute a single, massive load test to validate a specific infrastructure change, such as a "quarterly upgrade... of SBC, IVR, [or] dialer".
B. DevOps & Continuous Change Management
•	IVR Release Validation: For teams doing agile development, run automated regression scripts after every "IVR application release" to ensure new menu options function correctly and don't introduce latency.
•	Patch Verification: Automatically trigger a performance test "immediately after patching" server operating systems or applying service packs to confirm system stability has not degraded.
•	Routing Logic Verification: Validate "unplanned changes to call routing rules or business hours" to ensure calls are not being dropped or misrouted during complex flow modifications.
C. Self-Service Agility
•	DIY Script Execution: Enable internal QA or DevOps teams to "create, maintain and execute [their] own test scripts" for routine, small-scale checks without needing to engage a vendor for every minor test.
•	PSTN-Based Reality Checks: Generate traffic "through the PSTN" rather than just internally, ensuring the test captures the real-world impact of carrier routing and external network conditions.

3. ROI Metrics (Trackable Success)
•	Downtime Cost Avoidance:
o	Metric: Reduction in P1/P2 incidents immediately following a change window.
o	ROI Logic: Compare the cost of historical outages (lost revenue + SLA penalties) against the stability achieved after implementing pre-production performance testing.
•	Defect Escape Ratio:
o	Metric: Number of sev-1 defects found in testing vs. number found in production.
o	ROI Logic: Finding and fixing an issue in the test phase is exponentially cheaper than fixing it in production. This directly supports "reducing the frequency and severity of issues".
•	Change Success Rate:
o	Metric: Percentage of rollbacks required due to performance issues.
o	ROI Logic: Higher success rates mean less rework and faster "digital transformation".
•	Labor Savings (Troubleshooting):
o	Metric: Engineering hours spent on "all-hands troubleshooting" post-deployment.
o	ROI Logic: drastic reduction in emergency engineering overtime and "war room" scenarios.
