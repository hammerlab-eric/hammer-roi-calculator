Executive Summary
Hammer Edge is an endpoint observability and active monitoring platform designed to extend IT visibility beyond the corporate firewall to the "network edge" (remote agent homes, BPOs, and branch offices). For enterprises managing their own voice infrastructure, it bridges the gap between the controlled data center and the uncontrolled last-mile, enabling IT to distinguish between internal infrastructure faults (SBC/PBX) and external factors (Home WiFi/ISP).

1. Business Cases (Strategic Drivers)
•	Visibility into the "Uncontrolled" Edge (Work-from-Home/Anywhere):
o	Driver: With agents working remotely, IT lacks visibility into the local conditions (ISP latency, WiFi signal, local PC health) that degrade voice performance.
o	Solution: Deploying light-weight collectors on endpoints provides "complete transparency... into network, application, and system health" across the entire agent population, regardless of location.
•	Protection of VDI & Cloud Desktop Investments:
o	Driver: Enterprises using VDI (Citrix/VMware) often struggle to determine if lag is caused by the virtual desktop infrastructure or the user's physical connection.
o	Solution: Hammer Edge offers a unique "dual-perspective" by allowing collectors to be installed on both the physical local machine and the virtual desktop (VDI) simultaneously. This isolates whether the bottleneck is the "last mile" or the VDI environment itself.
•	Non-Intrusive On-Prem Voice Monitoring:
o	Driver: Monitoring legacy on-prem PBXs or SBCs often requires invasive probes that can impact system performance.
o	Solution: The "Reflector" collector type allows enterprises to measure service quality (MOS) by sitting on a subnet near the PBX, gathering statistics without directly impacting the critical voice infrastructure.
•	Security & Compliance Assurance:
o	Driver: Remote endpoints increase the attack surface, and enterprises need to ensure monitoring tools do not introduce vulnerabilities.
o	Solution: The platform uses TLS 1.3 for data in transit , AES-256 for data at rest , and is tested against OWASP Top 10 benchmarks , ensuring it meets strict DevSecOps specifications.

2. Use Cases (Operational Scenarios)
A. Remote Agent Troubleshooting (Home & ISP)
•	Root Cause Isolation (WiFi vs. ISP vs. VPN): When a remote agent reports "choppy audio," IT can view bi-directional jitter, packet loss, and latency measurements to determine if the issue is the agent's specific ISP or local WiFi connection.
•	Hardware Resource Bottlenecks: Detect if the agent's poor performance is due to local CPU/RAM exhaustion on their physical device rather than network issues, using "computer-based metrics".
B. Voice Infrastructure Assurance
•	PBX/SBC Health Monitoring (Reflector Mode): Deploy "Reflector" collectors in the data center to act as passive targets for tests, verifying the availability and quality of voice paths to the PBX without generating active load on the switch itself.
•	Voice Quality (MOS) Scoring: Continuously satisfy "voice MOS" and "VoiceRNA" requirements by measuring active voice quality streams from the edge back to the core.
C. VDI/Desktop Virtualization Support
•	VDI Correlation: Install collectors on the "Local Computer" and the "VDI Desktop" to capture metrics from both environments.
•	Scenario: If the local collector shows good network health but the VDI collector shows high latency, IT knows the issue lies within the virtualization gateway or server farm, not the user's internet.
D. Proactive Baseline & Change Validation
•	Off-Hours Validation: Automatically run tests after hours to validate system changes or patches before agents log in for their shift.
•	ISP Outage Discovery: Use "Auto ISP discovery" to group agents by internet provider and quickly identify regional ISP outages affecting multiple users.

3. ROI Metrics (Trackable Success)
A. Hard Cost Savings (Hardware & Support)
•	Hardware Refresh Optimization (Smart Spend)
o	Metric: Percentage of devices replaced based on actual performance data vs. age.
o	How to Track: Use "computer-based metrics" (Perfmon, WMI) to identify devices that are actually hitting CPU/RAM limits.
o	ROI Impact: Extend the life of capable hardware and only replace machines that are demonstrably impacting agent performance, avoiding blanket refresh costs.
•	Tier 1 Ticket Deflection
o	Metric: Reduction in "Network Connectivity" tickets escalated to Engineering.
o	How to Track: Measure the number of tickets resolved by Tier 1 support using Hammer Edge dashboard data (e.g., telling an agent "Your WiFi signal is 20%").
o	ROI Impact: drastically lowers the Cost Per Ticket by empowering service desk staff to close tickets without escalating to expensive network engineers.
B. Operational Efficiency (Productivity)
•	Reduction in "Mean Time to Innocence" (MTTI)
o	Metric: Time taken to prove the problem is not the Enterprise Network.
o	How to Track: Compare time-to-diagnosis for remote users before and after deployment. The tool enables "top-down and bottom-up perspectives" to instantly isolate the ISP or local PC.
o	ROI Impact: Critical for IT teams managing "Bring Your Own Dialtone" environments where proving the fault lies with the remote ISP is a daily challenge.
•	Agent Availability / Uptime
o	Metric: Reduction in agent downtime due to technical issues.
o	How to Track: Correlate "Total Users Connected" and health scores against agent login times.
o	ROI Impact: "Shrinkage reporting" capabilities help recover lost billable hours in BPO environments or reduces idle time in internal contact centers.
C. Revenue & Experience
•	CSAT/NPS Correlation
o	Metric: Correlation between "Agent Experience Scores" and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT).
o	How to Track: Map the "Experience Scores" (Good/Fair/Poor) to specific interaction outcomes.
o	ROI Impact: Prevents "decreasing CSAT scores and growing customer/agent churn" by ensuring agents have the technical stability required to serve customers effectively.
